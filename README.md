This is the data processing and plotting code used in my paper titled Methods for Estimating Arm Stiffness during Autonomous Robotic Ultrasound Collection. This code is fairly specific to the data collected from the automated ultrasound scanning system (i.e. force data, offset data) and performs the calculations talked about in the methods section of the paper.
